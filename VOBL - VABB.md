## Clearance -
To improve your experience and make your flight a little bit easier, the
recommended format for requesting clearance is given below.
## Requesting Clearance:

# PILOT: Bengaluru Delivery, Air India 142, Information B, Stand 20, Registration VT-SCV, Requesting IFR clearance to Mumbai, Requested Level [X].
## Clearance by the Controller:
# ATC: Air India 142, Bengaluru Delivery, Cleared to Mumbai via W56 [Airway], FL250 [Cleared Flight Level]. OPAMO7A departure, Runway 09L. Climb initially 7000 ft [Initial Climb]. Squawk 1234.

Note: the underlined items have to be readback compulsorily.


## After Clearance:
If the clearance readback is correct, the Controller will say:
# ATC: Air India 142, Readback correct. Report ready.
Pilots must report POB [Persons On Board (passengers+crew)] to Delivery when
requesting changeover (transfer to Ground controller).
## PILOT: Air India 142, persons on board 162 through security. Requesting
changeover.

# ATC: Air India 142, 162 copied. Contact Ground 121.650.
Pushback and Taxi:
Please note that there are three parallel taxi lanes in Apron 1 & 2 in Bengaluru,
namely L1, L2, and L3.

Please pay attention to the ATC instructions in your pushback clearance as
taxilanes L1 & L3 (outer lanes) support type C aircraft only (like A320/321, B738).
L2 is for larger aircraft.
Simultaneous pushback onto L1 & L3 are permitted. Aircraft can be made to
switch lanes between L1 & L3 while taxiing in case either one of them are blocked.

First Wings Briefing

## Takeoff:
1. Bengaluru Int’l (VOBL) has silent/auto-handoff procedures after departure,
therefore it is your responsibility to changeover to Bengaluru Approach
(127.750) after you’re airborne. You will not receive a handoff from Tower.
2. On initial contact with the Approach Controller, the pilot must report altitude
passing and SID.
# PILOT: Bengaluru Radar, Air India 142 passing 4000 ft, OPAMO7A departure.
Enroute:

## Route: VOBL OPAMO W56 AGELA VABB
Pilots must follow the assigned ATS route.
By default your cleared level will be FL250 regardless of your final level filed in the
flightplan. Once in contact with Chennai Control (VOMF_CTR), you can go ahead
and request your final level and depending on the availability/traffic, your
requested level will be assigned otherwise alternate levels will be provided to you.
PILOT: Chennai Control, Air India 142 passing FL235 for FL250. Requesting

FL320.

Pilots will hear “Radar services terminated” when being handed over from Chennai
Control to Mumbai Control. This does not mean that ATC is going offline, but rather
a term used when pilots are being handed off to a controller in a different
FIR/ACC.
## ATC: Air India 142, Radar services terminated. Contact Mumbai Control on

120.500.

(Pilot making contact with Mumbai Control)
# PILOT: Mumbai Control, Air India 142 FL320.
ATC: Air India 142, Mumbai Control. Identified. Continue as filed.



Arrival:
You’ll be given your arrival clearance before crossing the first fix of your arrival.

## ATC: Air India 142, Cleared to Mumbai via MOLGO2A arrival, AGELA

transition, runway 27.

Please note that the clearance has to be readback in full including the STAR
transition.
Pilots must not remove the discontinuity between the ending of the STAR and the
Initial Approach Fix (in this case, MB395 & CI27Z). ATC expects you to follow the
track given at the end of the STAR, and removing the discontinuity will lead to you
turning towards the Initial Approach Fix instead of following published procedure.
There may be cases where the pilot will be told to reach a certain level by a certain
waypoint.
# ATC: Air India 142, descend to reach FL80 by LIKTA. If unable to comply with level restrictions, inform ATC.

Due to the nature of
terrain around
Mumbai, pilots will
be given a heading
to intercept the
localizer initially at
3800 ft. Once clear of terrain, they’ll be instructed to descend to 2900 ft and then
cleared for the approach.
